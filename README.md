# Add hostname toppanel
GNOME Shell extension for 42 school. <br />
btw its not the hostname but the cluster position (the first args before the . in the hostname: e1r1p1.cluster.42paris.fr). <br />
I'm too lazy to change the name.
## How to install
1. Clone the repo.
2. Move the directory to `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`
3. Do `gnome-extensions enable add-hostname-toppanel` in any terminal.
4. If 3 fail, try to restart gnome with `alt+F2` or `alt+fn+F2` and type `r`.
